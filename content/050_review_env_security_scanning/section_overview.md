### Overview of Section

{{%expand "Click Here To Expand Content" %}}

This section does not have any specific new concepts.

It does put everything together by:

1. Using full Auto DevOps with per-branch review environments and staging and production on the App Build Project.
2. Using a Merge Request in the App Build Project to show the Developers “Single Pane of Glass” Merge Request view.
3. Enabling staging on the Environment Deployment Project.
4. Seeing an end-to-end change through all of the above.
