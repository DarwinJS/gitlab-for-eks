# Self-Paced Learner Fast Track

If you are a self-paced learner you can completely skip the Introduction section and simply do all the labs [Starting in section 2](../020_gitlab_integrated_eks).

While doing the labs any  **instructor-led notes** are for you because you are your own instructor ;)

The Introduction section does have information on troubleshooting and on reporting problems should you need to come back for that information.
