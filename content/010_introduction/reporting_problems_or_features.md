# Reporting Problems or Suggesting Features

Please use the  [Tuning and Troubleshooting Guide]({{< relref "./tuning_and_troubleshooting.md" >}}) to perform any troubleshooting before to solve problems or to generate good problem data to report.

## With Exercise Steps

1. Check for an existing problem report and possible solution here: https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/workshops/gitlab-for-eks/-/issues
2. If your problem is not yet reported, use the “New issue” button or click here to open a new issue: https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/workshops/gitlab-for-eks/-/issues/new
3. For a problem report, please:
   1. Be sure you have performed all the steps as they are documented, problems with workshop exercises are frequently due to missing or assuming steps or losing context for steps.
   2. Please be sure to include sufficient details and logs in all problem reports - think in terms of whether your report will be able to be understood if we don’t have the time to reproduce it before working on it.
