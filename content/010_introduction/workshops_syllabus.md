# AWS Workshops Syllabus and Audience

This information pertains to AWS Workshop specific deliveries. If you are an instructor for one of these deliveries, be sure to read [Instructor-Led Notes]({{< relref "../090_appendices/instructor_led_notes.md" >}}).

### Audience

#### You will get the most out of this content if you:

- Are in technical role or manage technical roles (most of the event time is spent doing hands-on exercises).
- Are in a role that works with or depends upon CI/CD automation, such as Application Developer, DevOps Engineer, CI/CD Engineer, Developer Productivity / Developer Advocate team member.
- Are interested in understanding and playing with how GitLab accelerates development to AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
- Are interested in understanding and hands-on configuring GitLabs new Kubernetes GitOps Pull CD and Configuration Enforcement technology (GitLab Agent for Kubernetes) - include a highly flexible and GitLab compatible method of configuring GitOps projects with good separation of concerns across a build project and a deploy project.
- Are interested in understanding and hands-on setting up GitLab to add its long standing DevSecOps value stream to the GitOps development workflows and best practices that have emerged from the GitOps community.
- Are interested in understanding how to migrate from GitLabs legacy “Certificate Connection Method” for Kubernetes to the new GitLab Agent for Kubernetes connection method. This includes understanding and playing with Auto DevOps, GitLab Dynamic Review Environments, Traditional Runner Based CD Push to Kubernetes and group level cluster integration.

### Syllabus

For AWS Workshops the following lab sections will be performed by participants:

1. [Labs Section 4. GitLab GitOps via the GitLab Agent for Kubernetes (Overview)]({{< relref "../040_gitlab_gitops_via_agent" >}})

2. [Labs Section 5. GitLab Review Environments and Security Scanning for GitOps (Overview)]({{< relref "../050_review_env_security_scanning" >}})

>  **Note:** Other lab sections in the navigation will not be covered - either because they are done ahead of time for you (e.g. Lab Section 2 - Provision and Integrate EKS) or the content they contain is already covered in other sections (e.g. Lab Section 3 - Using GitLab Agent for CD Push Deployment).

### Agenda

Deliveries of this content through AWS hosted workshops with Gitlab run 3.5 to 4 hours.
