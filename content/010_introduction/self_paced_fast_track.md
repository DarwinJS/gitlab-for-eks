# Self-Paced Learner Fast Track

If you are a self-paced learner you can completely skip the Introduction section and simply do all the labs [Starting in section 2]({{< relref "../020_gitlab_integrated_eks" >}})


You do need at least an AWS account and a GitLab account on a GitLab instance somewhere to get started.

While doing the labs any **instructor-led notes** are for **you** because you are your own instructor ;)

If you have a single monitor setup, you may benefit from printing the labs to avoid extreme context switching. Printable versions for labs are here: [Printable Labs]({{< relref "../010_introduction/printablepdfs.md" >}})

The following information may be of interest before you get started:

- [Learning Outcomes and Estimated Completion Time]({{< relref "../090_appendices/learning_outcomes.md" >}})
- [Troubleshooting]({{< relref "../090_appendices/tuning_and_troubleshooting.md" >}})
- [Reporting Problems or Features]({{< relref "../090_appendices/reporting_problems_or_features.md" >}})
