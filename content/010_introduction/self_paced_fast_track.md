# Self-Paced Learner Fast Track

If you are a self-paced learner you can completely skip the Introduction section and simply do all the labs [Starting in section 2]({{< relref "../020_gitlab_integrated_eks" >}})


You do need at least an AWS account and a GitLab account on a GitLab instance somewhere to get started.

While doing the labs any **instructor-led notes** are for **you** because you are your own instructor ;)

The Introduction section does have information on **troubleshooting** and on **reporting problems** should you need to come back for that information.
